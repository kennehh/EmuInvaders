# EmuInvaders

An Intel 8080 and Space Invaders emulator, written in C#. Done as a learning exercise for emulation.

Fully passes 8080EXM.COM, and Space Invaders is playable, including sound. Press C to insert a coin, enter to start, left and right arrows to move, and spacebar to shoot.

Requires SDL2 and SDL2_mixer to run, only tested on Windows.
